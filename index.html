                    <li>
                        <strong>1 Large Cup:</strong>
                        <p>Some people prefer to use a plate instead of a cup, but I’m used to mixing everything inside one of those large promo plastic cups that brands give away during events.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1 Fork:</strong>
                        <p>Essential for the recipe, don’t let any crazy person say to you that a spoon would do the job.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>3 Eggs:</strong>
                        <p>Mayonnaise Salad has a bad reputation because it is made with raw eggs, but you won’t need to worry if the eggs were treated carefully. To do so take a deep bowl or a container, fill it with water and submerge the eggs in it, if the egg floats, it’s spoiled and you will need to throw it away.  So remember, choosing the best eggs is the key for a good mayonnaise.
Free range chicken eggs tend to have orange yolks, giving the mayonnaise a richer color, which is a plus.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>½ Bottle of Oil:</strong>
                        <p>This is an approximate measurement, maybe you will use more or less depending on how the mixing goes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1 Lemon or 2 spoons of Vinegar:</strong>
                        <p>Could be replaced by milk or even water because their role is to make the cream lighter, but the lemon or vinegar add a welcome acidity.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>5 Pinches of Salt:</strong>
                        <p>Well it’s salt… Just the best seasoning. Use more, use less, you will figure it out.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>5 Large Potatoes:</strong>
                        <p>The amount of potatoes will dictate how “liquid” the mayonnaise salad will be. I prefer it “dry”, so in the balance between cream and potato, I’m at the potato side. At the end of the recipe there is a guide on how to add more potatoes to make the mayonnaise salad go further.</p>
                    </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Extra Vegetables (Optional):</strong>
                        <p>My favourite ones are canned corn (1 can), carrot (2) and parsley (1 sprig). Some people would add apples to the mayonnaise, but it’s a crime and if you see someone doing that, call the police!</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Boil two out of the three eggs. I won’t teach you how to boil eggs, but here is a <strong>tip:</strong> Add a vinegar team spoon to the water before it’s boiling, this will make it easier to peel the eggs.
                        </br>After you peel it, separate the egg white from the yolk, reserve the yolk in the fridge, they must not be hot when you start doing the cream. The egg white can be cut in cubes and added among the potatoes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Peel the raw potatoes, cut them in cubes, put the cubes into a fitting pan, fill it with water until everything is covered and boil it in high heat. It will be ready when the potatoes become soft, but not too soft (you don’t want the potatoes to be smashed during the mixing on step 4).
                        </br>If you decided to add carrots to the mayonnaise salad, you will need to boil them together with the potatoes. Don't forget to peel and cut the carrot in cubes as well.
                        </br>After it’s done, remove the water and reserve it in the fridge, the potatoes/carrots must not be hot when mixed with the cream.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Start making THE CREAM. Take the two already cold egg yolks and put them into the large cup, add the raw egg yolk to the large cup, just the yolk, the raw egg white won’t have use in this recipe. Mix all of the three yolks and start adding oil, you will add up to 20ml of oil.
                        </br>To know if you reached the limit of the cream pay attention to how often it starts to break, it is normal to seems like it’s going to break once or twice during the process, like when you add too much oil, but if it starts to break too often, then the eggs are reaching its emulsification limit, so it’s homogenous and then mix it with the potatoes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add salt and the juice of a full lemon, remember that you can replace the lemon by two spoons of vinegar. Again, mix everything until it is homogenous and then mix it with the potatoes.
                        </br>If you are willing to add canned corn and parsley, this is the moment.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <ul>
                    <li>If you are in a hurry and added too much oil in one of the oil dips, then you will be in a situation where the cream is breaking, to save it add a tea spoon of vinegar.</li>
                    <li>If you are preparing the mayonnaise to more people, let’s say you are doubling the amount of potatoes, then you will need to double the amount of boiled yolks. You will add all of the boiled yolks to one cup and proceed with step 3 as usual (using only one raw yolk). Once you reach the top of the cup, transfer half of the cup’s content to another cup, then finish up step 3 and do the step 4 on both cups, but be careful to not let it too salty.</li>
